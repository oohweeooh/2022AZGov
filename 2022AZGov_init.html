Virtually all polls suggest a clear Lake victory after a very close Republican primary, while Hobbs has endured attacks over the legality of her campaign while remaining Secretary of State. To clinch victory, Hobbs must hold the line against Lake's Trump-fueled extremism while winning over enough independent voters to topple Lake's lead.<p></p>\nCan Hobbs become the first Democrat governor to be elected since 2006, or will Lake expand her early lead to an easy victory?\n</p>",

It looks like all the polls were wrong, and against all odds you have somehow managed to win. Without a doubt this election has been one of the most contentious in the state’s history and your win will likely be challenged in court by Kari Lake, but that doesn’t matter to you right now. Right now, all that matters is that the people of Arizona trust you to lead and by God are you going to lead. At the same time as your election, returns come back in other races. You’ll have a Democratic Attorney General and Secretary of State, but you’ll have to work with your Republican Treasurer, Superintendent, and the narrowly Republican-controlled state Legislature to pass any of your agenda.<p></p>\nWith your election, you become the first ever social worker to become Governor and you are the fifth female Governor, more than any other state. \n</p>",

It seems that the polls were right, you just don’t have what it takes to beat Kari Lake. Without a doubt, this is the end of your political career so it might be time to dust off that social worker jacket. Luckily you will be able to turn over your current office of Secretary of State over to a Democrat so you have peace of mind knowing that elections will stay safe and secure at least until the next election. Unfortunately, Republicans still hold the Attorney General’s office so no doubt abortion rights will come under even more attacks and with a Republican majority in the state Legislature, Kari Lake has free reign to pass all the bills she wants.</p>",
